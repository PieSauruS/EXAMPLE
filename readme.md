I'm not sure if this project will ever really take off. Nonetheless, it never hurts to make a readme.

The goal of this program is to enhance the filtering experience in available video games. The program shall act as a filtering option and allow users to also review
other players that they have just recently played with.

The filtering options should include:
    -Number of hours played
    -Number of games played
    -Number of positive commendations
    -Number of negative commendations
    -Lastly, a very easy filter bar that is based
    on the player's overall rating.

Relational Database will be managed in Postgresql.
It will be interfaced with C++, and I have not decided on a gui but there will be one.
